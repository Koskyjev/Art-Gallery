        <h2>The Mona Lisa</h2>
            <img src="/IMG/monalisa.jpg" alt="monalisa">

        <p> Mona Lisa is undeniably the most famous painting in the world. Even among those who typically don’t consider themselves art lovers, but the mere mention of the Mona Lisa will always elicit a response.

        <h2>Starry Night</h2>
            <img src="/IMG/starrynight.jpg" alt="starrynight">
    
        <p> This oil on wood painting was painted by Vincent Van Gogh in June 1889. This is another world-famous piece and one of Van Gogh’s most well-known works. The painting supposedly depicts the view from the east-facing window of the  Saint-Rémy-de-Provence asylum where Van Gogh was held after cutting off his ear.

        <img src="/IMG/scream.jpg" alt="scream">

    <p>The Scream was painted by Edvard Munch in 1893. The Scream is part of two paintings, one of which sold in 2012 for nearly £74 million in. But, much like the Mona Lisa, the Scream became widely recognised  because of its theft.

        <h2>Birth of Venus</h2>
        <img src="/IMG/birthofvenus.jpg" alt="birthofvenus">

    <p> Sandro Botticelli painted this famous painting in 1485, making this one of the oldest paintings to make the list of the most famous paintings of all time. Given the age of this painting, little proof exists surrounding the back story of the artwork, but it is believed to have been commissioned by the Medici family.

        <h2>The Last Supper</h2>
        <img src="/IMG/lastsupper.jpeg" alt="lastsupper">

    <p> Leonardo da Vinci has plenty of renowned artwork that has become synonymous with the Italian Renaissance and yet The Last Supper stands out among them. Painted between 1494 to 1498, the painting is unique because it wasn’t painted on canvas but rather a larger than life-sized fresco that is 4 metres tall and 8.8 metres wide.
